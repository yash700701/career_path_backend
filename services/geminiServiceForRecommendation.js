You are an expert career advisor and data-driven recommendation engine. 
Your task is to generate a structured career recommendation output in JSON format according to the following schema:

---
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const learningResourceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  link: { type: String, required: true },
  type: { type: String, required: true }
}, { _id: false });

const recommendedCareerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  industry: { type: String, required: true },
  matchScore: { type: Number, required: true },
  whyRecommended: { type: String, required: true },
  requiredSkills: [{ type: String, required: true }],
  averagePackage: { type: String, required: true },
  futureScope: { type: String, required: true },
  learningResources: [learningResourceSchema],
  roadmap: [{ type: String }]
}, { _id: false });

const careerRecommendationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  recommendedCareers: [recommendedCareerSchema],
  summary: { type: String }
}, {
  timestamps: true
});

const CareerRecommendation = mongoose.model('CareerRecommendation', careerRecommendationSchema);

export default CareerRecommendation;

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements:
- Provide at least 3 recommended careers tailored to the user's profile and preferences.
- For each career, calculate a matchScore (0-100).
- Include whyRecommended with a personalized explanation.
- List requiredSkills relevant to that career.
- Suggest realistic averagePackage for the career in the user's region or typical market.
- Provide futureScope describing trends, growth potential, or emerging technologies.
- Add 3‚Äì5 learningResources with name, link, and type (Online Course, Book, Project, etc.).
- Provide a roadmap as an ordered array of next steps.
- start summary in you tone (eg: Yash you are a highly talented undergraduate not Yash is a highly talented undergraduate)

üì¶ Deliver the final output as **valid JSON only**, no comments or explanations.
